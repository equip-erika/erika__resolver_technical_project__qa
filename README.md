# Welcome to Erika's technical assessment project
Please see the site > guide.html page for the technical assessment requirements.

## Notes
* Any _Test #_ prefixed points in _Things left TO DO_ are beyond the immediate requirements. I'm noting them because they are areas of testing I would wish to tackle if I had time. 
* If this were not an assessment, I would choose a different method to access appropriate email/password test data for Test 1. I am making an assumption that this assessment does not require the complexity of secure data handling.

## Things left TO DO
* Investigate baseUrl in wdio.conf.js not pre-appending.
* Test 1: test email validation errors
* Test 1: test empty field validation errors

## Things fixed outside of scope
* On site/guide.html, updated misspelling "choise" to correct spelling "choice".
